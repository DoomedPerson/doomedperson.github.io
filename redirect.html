            <div id="header">Spectrographic Analysis of DC Plasma: Mapping Voltage, Pressure, and Temperature Relationships for Optimized Applications</div>
            <div id="header2">By: Lucius Carr, Christopher Boggs, Mwanza Lungu, John Edwards, Caleb Kasero</div>

            <p>This webpage holds similar information to our research poster, however in a written format with more space for graphs and deeper explanations of our methodology.</p>

            <div id="header3">Theory</div>
            <p>DC plasma generators use high-voltage cathodes and anodes to accelerate the light electrons to very high speeds. These high-speed electrons collide with and excite neutral particles. While many factors influence plasmas' formation and subsequent properties, we are particularly interested in the effect of voltage and pressure. The kinetic energy (KE) change of an electron in an electric field is given by \( \color{white}}{\Delta KE = e\Delta V} \). This shows that increasing the voltage of our system should increase the speed and, likewise, the ionizing potential of electrons in the plasma. It is hypothesized that increasing the voltage will increase the magnitude of our peaks, however, it could also decrease the magnitude as the ionization energy starts favoring different transitions. Likewise, altering the pressure of the gas should have an impact on the plasma, particularly in how the energy is distributed. This is due to factors such as the mean free path of the electron being altered as the pressure of the gas changes. It can be shown that \(\color{white}{\lambda_{mfp} \propto \frac{P}{T}} \). It is hypothesized that decreasing pressure will initially strengthen the plasmas’ peaks, as it forms, and then subsequently drop in intensity when the pressure gets very low.</p>
            
            <p>The principle behind estimating the electron temperature (\(T_e\)​) in a plasma using spectroscopy is based on the interaction between electrons and atoms in the discharge. In a DC glow discharge, the electrons in the plasma collide with neutral atoms, exciting them to higher energy states. These excited atoms then emit light as they return to lower energy states. The intensity of these spectral lines is related to the population of the excited states, which in turn depends on the electron energy distribution in the plasma. Under the assumption of a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for the electrons, the population of excited states is given by the Boltzmann factor, \(\color{white}{n_k∝g_{k}e^{-Ek/k_BT_e}}\)​​ where \(n_k​\) is the population of an excited state \(k\), \(g_k\)​ is the degeneracy factor, \(E_k\) is the energy of the excited state, \(k_B\)​ is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T_e\) is the electron temperature.</p>

            <p>The intensity of a spectral line, \(I_{ik}\)​, corresponding to a transition from an upper level \(k\) to a lower level \(i\), is proportional to the product of the population of the excited states and the transition probability. Mathematically, the intensity can be written as:</p>
              
            <p>\(I_{ik}=\frac{\hbar cA_{ki}}{2λ_{ki}}\)</p>
              
            <p>  where \(\hbar\) is the reduced Planck's constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, \(A_{ki}\)​ is the transition probability, and \(λ_{ki}\) is the wavelength of the emitted light. Substituting the expression for \(n_k\) into this equation and taking the natural logarithm gives the equation for a Boltzmann plot:</p>
            
            <p>\(\ln[\frac{λ_{ki}I_{ki}}{g_kA_{ki}}]=(-\frac{E_k}{k_BT_e})+C\)</p>
              
            <p>where \(C\) is a constant that includes factors like the spectrometer response and plasma length. By plotting the logarithm of the intensity versus the energy of the upper level, the slope of the resulting line gives the electron temperature, \(T_e\)​, from which the temperature can be determined by using the relation:
              \(T_e=-\frac{1}{k_B*\text{slope}}\).
              This method allows the estimation of the electron temperature from the spectral intensities of the emission lines. 
              </p>


            <p>Finally, understanding non-invasive methods to predict and analyze plasma is important due to its application in the efficiency of plasma-based applications.</p>

          <div id="header3">Methods</div>


          <p>Our procedure was generally straight-forward. We used an OceanView spectrometer to measure the spectral intensity between 650-1050nm wavelengths, while tweaking factors such as voltage and pressure. We tweaked these factors independently. We measured at the Anode and Cathode, and took some measurements at different striations. To measure temperature, we utilized the NIST database to find energy, transition probability, and degeneracy for different wavelengths of Argon present in our sample. This data was used to perform our Boltzmann Plot calculations.</p>

            <div id="header3">Results</div>



            <p>We found that the air plasma’s wavelength intensity reacted strongly to the change in voltage. As voltage increased the intensity of the wavelengths also increased, as shown in graphs E-G. Air didn’t have any strong, noticeable spectral shifts upon changing pressure when voltage remained constant. The intensity remained at a similar level as the pressure lowered. Graphs B-D show this. We still believe pressure has an effect, it is possible this effect is negligable in air for the pressure range we tested.</p>

            <p>The electron temperatures calculated with our Boltzmann plot are lower than we should expect. This could be due to our choice of argon lines for the plot, and their minimal intensity in our samples. Still, the temperature followed a trend consistent with our hypothesis, where temperature raised with voltage. In the future we hope to fine-tune our temperature measurement methods, and run experiments on how the temperature changes with location relative to the cathode and anode.</p>

            <div id="header">Maze Generator & Solver</div>

            <p>This project was a simple goal of mine since I read about pathfinding algorithms in one of my AI textbooks, my goal was simple make an agent that goes from point a to point b and mess around with a few algorithms for doing so. I also wanted to practice with SFML, as it was one of my first projects in SFML there was a bit more clutter than I would like. Initially upon loading up Visual Studio I realized that if I wanted an agent to solve a maze I would, well, need a maze. So I got to reading and decided to implement a depth first algorithm for generating a maze, as seen below,</p>

            <video width="300px" height="400px" autoplay muted loop>
            <source src="videos/Maze_Gen.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
            </video>

            <p>Great! We have a pretty decent maze, now we can implement a solver. I've tried with quite a few heuristics, with varying degrees of success, below is my implementation of a manhatten distance heuristic,</p>

            <source src="videos/Maze_Solve.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
            </video>

            <p>It certainly works! I learned a lot about SFML and a little about maze generation, although if I do it again I'll try a completely different method as I feel my implementation of the depth first algorithm created relatively predictable paths. Overall this was a fun project that challenged me to try something I had never done before.</p>
