            <div id="header">Spectrographic Analysis of DC Plasma: Mapping Voltage, Pressure, and Temperature Relationships for Optimized Applications</div>
            <div id="header2">By: Lucius Carr, Christopher Boggs, Mwanza Lungu, John Edwards, Caleb Kasero</div>

            <p>This webpage holds similar information to our research poster, however in a written format with more space for graphs and deeper explanations of our methodology.</p>

            <div id="header3">Theory</div>
            <p>DC plasma generators use high-voltage cathodes and anodes to accelerate the light electrons to very high speeds. These high-speed electrons collide with and excite neutral particles. While many factors influence plasmas' formation and subsequent properties, we are particularly interested in the effect of voltage and pressure. The kinetic energy (KE) change of an electron in an electric field is given by \( \color{red}{\Delta KE = e\Delta V} \). This shows that increasing the voltage of our system should increase the speed and, likewise, the ionizing potential of electrons in the plasma. It is hypothesized that increasing the voltage will increase the magnitude of our peaks, however, it could also decrease the magnitude as the ionization energy starts favoring different transitions. Likewise, altering the pressure of the gas should have an impact on the plasma, particularly in how the energy is distributed. This is due to factors such as the mean free path of the electron being altered as the pressure of the gas changes. It can be shown that \(\color{red}{\lambda_{mfp} \propto \frac{P}{T}} \). It is hypothesized that decreasing pressure will initially strengthen the plasmas’ peaks, as it forms, and then subsequently drop in intensity when the pressure gets very low.</p>
            
            <p>The principle behind estimating the electron temperature (\(T_e\)​) in a plasma using spectroscopy is based on the interaction between electrons and atoms in the discharge. In a DC glow discharge, the electrons in the plasma collide with neutral atoms, exciting them to higher energy states. These excited atoms then emit light as they return to lower energy states. The intensity of these spectral lines is related to the population of the excited states, which in turn depends on the electron energy distribution in the plasma. Under the assumption of a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for the electrons, the population of excited states is given by the Boltzmann factor, \(\color{white}{n_k∝g_{k}e^{-Ek/k_BT_e}}\)​​ where \(n_k​\) is the population of an excited state \(k\), \(g_k\)​ is the degeneracy factor, \(E_k\) is the energy of the excited state, \(k_B\)​ is Boltzmann's constant, and \(T_e\) is the electron temperature.</p>

            <p>The intensity of a spectral line, \(I_{ik}\)​, corresponding to a transition from an upper level \(k\) to a lower level \(i\), is proportional to the product of the population of the excited states and the transition probability. Mathematically, the intensity can be written as:</p>
              
            <p>\(I_{ik}=\frac{\hbar cA_{ki}}{2λ_{ki}}\)</p>
              
            <p>  where \(\hbar\) is the reduced Planck's constant, \(c\) is the speed of light, \(A_{ki}\)​ is the transition probability, and \(λ_{ki}\) is the wavelength of the emitted light. Substituting the expression for \(n_k\) into this equation and taking the natural logarithm gives the equation for a Boltzmann plot:</p>
            
            <p>\(\ln[\frac{λ_{ki}I_{ki}}{g_kA_{ki}}]=(-\frac{E_k}{k_BT_e})+C\)</p>
              
            <p>where \(C\) is a constant that includes factors like the spectrometer response and plasma length. By plotting the logarithm of the intensity versus the energy of the upper level, the slope of the resulting line gives the electron temperature, \(T_e\)​, from which the temperature can be determined by using the relation:
              \(T_e=-\frac{1}{k_B*\text{slope}}\).
              This method allows the estimation of the electron temperature from the spectral intensities of the emission lines. 
              </p>

          <div id="header3">Methods</div>


          <p>Our procedure was generally straight-forward. We used an OceanView spectrometer to measure the spectral intensity between 650-1050nm wavelengths, while tweaking factors such as voltage and pressure. We tweaked these factors independently. We measured at the Anode and Cathode, and took some measurements at different striations. To measure temperature, we utilized the NIST database to find energy, transition probability, and degeneracy for different wavelengths of Argon present in our sample. This data was used to perform our Boltzmann Plot calculations.</p>

            <p>I got the distances from almanacs and used a combination of cosine and sine to transpose the distance into 2-dimensional coordinates. The result was something like this: </p>

                <source src="videos/initialsolarvideo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
            </video>

            
            
            <p>Then came the issues, I wanted to sync up the planets positions in this simulation with their positions at any given time. I started by calculating the anomalies of the planets at the J2000 Epoch, with that base I firstly tried using the mean velocities of the planets to estimate where they would be after a given time. This unfortunately did not scale well at all, and logically it wouldn't even work on short scale projects. My next thought was iteration to get more specific velocities, this unfortunately did not work either and took exponentially longer to calculate. I tried many, many methods. All to varying levels of success. I decided to take a step back and I read Astronomical Algorithms by Jean Meeus, it was an excellent text and gave me many more ideas, I continued studying on orbital simulation and decided my method for calculating the positions of the planets at a given time would be the JSOP87 model.</p>

            <p>I had recently gone camping at this time and while peering into the night sky I wondered which 'stars' I saw in the sky corresponded with which planets. For this reason I wanted my next attempt to be made for mobile devices, the goal, was making a functioning and up to date model of the solar system that would allow me to select a planet and get information about where it is in the sky, when it would rise, when it would set, or any combination of data of this manner.</p>

            <p>I don't make mobile apps often but decided to use Flutter and Dart to host my solar system. I started with calculating the current Julian Date and getting to work on displaying the solar system.</p>

            <p>With the julian date I calculated the heliocentric cartesian coordinates of all the planets, I then put them on a plane and displayed them, I also added zooming and panning to make it easier to select and choose planets down the line.</p>

                <source src="videos/solarsystemscrollpan.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
            </video>

            <p>I then converted the heliocentric coordinates to geocentric coordinates so I could calculate the right ascension and declination of each planet.</p>


            <p>Awesome! Now with the Latitude and Longitude of a user I can calculate when when a planet will rise or fall, but what I found most important was calculating the azimuth and altitude, I'll show the equations for those too,</p>



            <p>If you don't know azimuth is where a celestial object is in the sky relative to north of an observer, and altitude is the height of the celestial object in the sky.</p>

            <p>I added a layer of text a tthe bottom of my simulation that would be used for information about the selected planet as shown below,</p>

            <img id="img" width = "400px" height="400px" style="padding-left: 20px" src="photos/jupiterinfo.png"></img>

            <p>All the pieces are in place! I added a compass and a sensor to the app that will allow me to check what direction my phone is pointing in horizontally and vertically. Then I added a guide mode to the app that would work kind of like a compass, guiding you to your selected planet.</p>
        
            <img id="img" width = "400px" height="320px" style="padding-left: 20px" src="photos/neptunetrack.png"></img>

            <p>The arrow will always point in the direction of the planet and the bar on the right will shrink depending on how close you are to pointing in the correct vertical direction.</p>

            <p>The next night I went out to test if: 1) my app worked 2) I was correct about which planet I was seeing at night.
            Sure enough, both conditions one and two were satisfied! I now hold the ability to select any planet or the sun and see where it is in the sky and other cool facts that go with it!
            </p>

            <p>The project isn't finished, for instance, I would like to add the moon to my model, but overall it works amazingly well and I learned a lot while making it!</p>

            <p>Thanks for reading. :)</p>

        <div class="project2" id="maze_gen.proj" style="display: none;">
            <div id="header">Maze Generator & Solver</div>

            <p>This project was a simple goal of mine since I read about pathfinding algorithms in one of my AI textbooks, my goal was simple make an agent that goes from point a to point b and mess around with a few algorithms for doing so. I also wanted to practice with SFML, as it was one of my first projects in SFML there was a bit more clutter than I would like. Initially upon loading up Visual Studio I realized that if I wanted an agent to solve a maze I would, well, need a maze. So I got to reading and decided to implement a depth first algorithm for generating a maze, as seen below,</p>

            <video width="300px" height="400px" autoplay muted loop>
            <source src="videos/Maze_Gen.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
            </video>

            <p>Great! We have a pretty decent maze, now we can implement a solver. I've tried with quite a few heuristics, with varying degrees of success, below is my implementation of a manhatten distance heuristic,</p>

            <video width="300px" height="400px" autoplay muted loop>
            <source src="videos/Maze_Solve.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
            </video>

            <p>It certainly works! I learned a lot about SFML and a little about maze generation, although if I do it again I'll try a completely different method as I feel my implementation of the depth first algorithm created relatively predictable paths. Overall this was a fun project that challenged me to try something I had never done before.</p>
